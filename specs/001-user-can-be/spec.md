# Feature Specification: User Authentication for API Access

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-can-be`  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "user can be authenticated to make api request"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

- Q: Registration default role assignment (deferring role-based access features) → A: All users registered as "user" role by default, role field stored but not enforced yet
- Q: Token refresh strategy → A: Implement refresh tokens (long-lived tokens to get new access tokens without re-login)
- Q: Rate limiting for failed login attempts → A: Do not implement rate limiting in this phase (deferred to future implementation)
- Q: Refresh token storage → A: Database storage with user association (enables revocation, logout tracking)
- Q: Password reset flow completion → A: Simplified reset (email with time-limited reset token, user sets new password)
- Q: Test requirements for authentication feature → A: Unit tests and API tests are deferred; implementation can proceed without test coverage initially (tests can be added later)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Registration (Priority: P1)

A new citizen wants to register an account to report damaged roads in their area. They provide basic information and receive immediate access to the system.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for all users. Without registration, no one can use the system. This represents the most critical user journey that enables all other features.

**Independent Test**: Acceptance scenarios define expected behavior for implementation verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user on the registration page, **When** I provide valid name, email, and password, **Then** my account is created and I receive a confirmation
2. **Given** I just registered successfully, **When** I attempt to access protected API endpoints with my credentials, **Then** I can make authenticated requests
3. **Given** I am registering, **When** I provide an email that already exists in the system, **Then** I receive a clear error message that the email is already registered
4. **Given** I am registering, **When** I provide invalid data (e.g., malformed email, weak password), **Then** I receive specific validation error messages

---

### User Story 2 - User Login (Priority: P1)

An existing user wants to log into their account to report or verify road damage reports. They provide their credentials and gain access to the system.

**Why this priority**: Equal to registration in priority since returning users are the majority of traffic. Without login, registered users cannot access the system.

**Independent Test**: Acceptance scenarios define expected behavior for implementation verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I provide correct email and password, **Then** I am successfully authenticated and can access protected resources
2. **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I provide incorrect password, **Then** I receive an authentication error and cannot access protected resources
3. **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I successfully log in, **Then** I receive a secure token that I can use for subsequent API requests
4. **Given** I have an authentication token, **When** I make API requests with the token, **Then** the system recognizes me and my role (regular user or verificator)

---

### User Story 3 - Session Management (Priority: P2)

A logged-in user expects their session to remain valid for a reasonable period and be notified when it expires, requiring re-authentication.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience by balancing security with convenience. Not critical for MVP but important for production usage.

**Independent Test**: Acceptance scenarios define expected behavior for implementation verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in with a valid token, **When** my token expires, **Then** API requests return an authentication error indicating token expiration
2. **Given** my token is about to expire, **When** I make an API request, **Then** I receive information about token expiration time
3. **Given** my token has expired, **When** I attempt to access protected resources, **Then** I must log in again to get a new token

---

### User Story 3a - Token Refresh (Priority: P2)

A logged-in user with an expired access token but valid refresh token can obtain a new access token without re-entering credentials.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience by reducing login friction while maintaining security. Users don't need to re-authenticate frequently.

**Independent Test**: Acceptance scenarios define expected behavior for implementation verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a valid refresh token, **When** my access token expires, **Then** I can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without re-login
2. **Given** I have an invalid or expired refresh token, **When** I attempt to refresh, **Then** I receive an error and must log in again
3. **Given** I successfully refresh my access token, **When** I make API requests with the new token, **Then** my session continues seamlessly

---

### User Story 3b - User Logout (Priority: P2)

A logged-in user wants to explicitly end their session securely, invalidating all tokens.

**Why this priority**: Security best practice allowing users to end sessions on shared devices or when security is compromised.

**Independent Test**: Acceptance scenarios define expected behavior for implementation verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I logout, **Then** my refresh token is revoked in the database and I cannot use it again
2. **Given** I have logged out, **When** I attempt to use my old access token, **Then** I receive an authentication error (token still expires normally but refresh is blocked)
3. **Given** I have logged out, **When** I attempt to refresh using my old refresh token, **Then** I receive an error indicating the token is revoked

---

### User Story 4 - Role-Based Access (Priority: DEFERRED)

**DEFERRED TO FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION**: Users with different roles (regular users vs. verificators) will need appropriate access to different API endpoints based on their permissions. This feature is explicitly out of scope for the current authentication implementation phase.

**Why deferred**: While core to the business model, role-based authorization can be added after basic authentication works. The user role field will be stored but not enforced in this phase.

**Note**: All users in this phase can access all authenticated endpoints equally.

---

### User Story 5 - Password Security (Priority: P3)

Users want assurance that their passwords are handled securely and can reset them if forgotten using a simple email-based flow.

**Why this priority**: Important for security and user trust but can be added after core authentication is working. Password reset is a common need but not required for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Acceptance scenarios define expected behavior for implementation verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am creating an account, **When** I provide a password, **Then** it is stored securely using industry-standard hashing (not plain text)
2. **Given** I forgot my password, **When** I request a password reset, **Then** I receive an email with a time-limited reset token (valid for 1 hour)
3. **Given** I received a password reset email, **When** I click the reset link with valid token, **Then** I can set a new password
4. **Given** I have a password reset token, **When** I use it after expiration (>1 hour), **Then** I receive an error and must request a new reset
5. **Given** I successfully reset my password, **When** the reset token is used, **Then** it is invalidated and cannot be reused
6. **Given** I am setting a new password, **When** I provide a weak password, **Then** I receive feedback on password strength requirements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user attempts to register with an email that was previously deleted?
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts from the same account?
- What happens when a token is used after the user has logged out?
- How does the system handle malformed or tampered authentication tokens?
- What happens when a verificator's role is revoked while they have an active session?
- How does the system handle extremely long input in email or password fields?
- What happens when a user provides SQL injection attempts or script tags in their credentials?
- How does the system handle authentication requests during high load or database unavailability?

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a registered account in the system
  - Core attributes: unique identifier, name, email (unique), hashed password, role (user/verificator), registration timestamp, last login timestamp
  - Relationships: A user creates multiple road damage reports; a verificator can verify multiple reports; a user can have multiple refresh tokens
  
- **Authentication Token**: Represents an active user session
  - Core attributes: access token string (JWT), user identifier, role, issue time, expiration time
  - Relationships: Associated with one user; validates access to protected resources
  - Note: Access tokens are stateless JWT (not stored in database)
  
- **Refresh Token**: Represents long-lived token for obtaining new access tokens
  - Core attributes: refresh token string (UUID or secure random), user identifier, issue time, expiration time (30 days), revoked flag (for logout/security), last used timestamp
  - Relationships: Associated with one user; stored in database to enable revocation and logout tracking
  - Note: Stored in database to support explicit revocation and security auditing

- **Password Reset Token**: Represents time-limited token for password reset
  - Core attributes: reset token string (UUID or secure random), user identifier, issue time, expiration time (1 hour), used flag
  - Relationships: Associated with one user; enables secure password recovery
  - Note: Single-use token that expires after 1 hour or successful password reset

- **Authentication Event Log**: Represents security audit trail
  - Core attributes: timestamp, user identifier (if known), event type (login success, login failure, token validation, token refresh, logout, password reset request, password reset success, etc.), IP address, user agent
  - Relationships: Associated with user attempts and security monitoring

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New users can complete registration in under 1 minute with valid information
- **SC-002**: Registered users can successfully log in and receive authentication token in under 5 seconds
- **SC-003**: System correctly enforces role-based access (role field stored but not enforced in this phase - deferred)
- **SC-004**: System handles concurrent authentication requests without performance degradation
- **SC-005**: Invalid authentication attempts are blocked with clear error messages (valid users never incorrectly blocked)
- **SC-006**: Password strength requirements prevent weak passwords (common passwords, dictionary words, sequential characters)
- **SC-007**: All authentication tokens expire correctly after their validity period
- **SC-008**: Refresh token mechanism works seamlessly, allowing users to maintain sessions without re-login for up to 30 days
- **SC-009**: Users can successfully complete login with correct credentials
- **SC-010**: All authentication events are logged for security audit

**Note**: Automated test coverage is deferred and can be added later. Success is measured through manual verification and production monitoring.

## Assumptions

1. **Email Uniqueness**: We assume each user has only one account per email address (no multi-account support initially)
2. **Token Storage**: Tokens are stateless JWT tokens, not stored in database (enabling horizontal scaling)
3. **Password Reset**: Basic password reset via email is sufficient; no SMS or multi-factor authentication required for MVP
4. **Role Assignment**: User role is assigned during registration and can only be changed by system administrators (no self-service role upgrade)
5. **Session Management**: Single active session per user is acceptable (concurrent sessions from same account allowed for MVP)
6. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All authentication endpoints will be served over HTTPS in production (enforced at infrastructure level)
7. **Email Delivery**: Email service for password reset is available and reliable (default to console logging for development)
8. **Database Availability**: PostgreSQL database is the primary authentication data store and is highly available
9. **Geographic Scope**: Initially targeting Indonesian users (localization for Indonesian language can be added later)
10. **Browser/Client Support**: API clients are responsible for storing and sending tokens in request headers (standard Bearer token format)

## Dependencies

- PostgreSQL database must be operational for user data persistence
- Email service integration for password reset functionality (can be mocked in development)
- HTTPS/TLS configuration at deployment level for secure token transmission

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this feature:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA)
- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- OAuth2 integration with third-party services
- Biometric authentication
- Account deletion or deactivation
- Profile picture upload during registration
- Email verification requirement before account activation
- Password complexity scoring UI
- "Remember me" functionality
- Session management dashboard
- IP-based geolocation or access restrictions
- CAPTCHA for registration or login
- Rate limiting or account lockout after multiple failed attempts (deferred to future implementation)
- Role-based access control enforcement (role field stored but not enforced in this phase)
